## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Docker Compose

To be able to create the database, just run the following command:
```
docker compose up -d
```
This will not only create a docker container with postgres as the database, but it will also create the tables and fill them
